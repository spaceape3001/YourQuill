# Your Quill

Your Quill is about world building for stories, universes, D&D campaigns, or even trying to keep track of who's who in Game of Thrones.   Your Quill will be a collection of tools to assist the author/creator in developing their world.

**Data resides with the USER** is an important mantra in this development, thus the user controls any "cloud".




(TODO--FILL THIS IN)



## Additional Information

### Building

Your Quill uses CMake for build management and C++20 as the language standard.  On linux, the build type is determined based on the final directory name (ie build/Debug vs build/Release).
